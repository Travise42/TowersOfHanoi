# TowersOfHanoi
Recreation of Towers of Hanoi using Colored chips

This was created at the start 2022. This was a quick project I started and I didn't have any intention of going any further with it... other than potentially adding a "hint" button that tells you the next best move, or a counter that compaires how well you've done to the best possible solution.

The code wasn't designed to be neat, readable, or efficient as I don't plan to look at it again. I just wanted to play towers of hanoi.
